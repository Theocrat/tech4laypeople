# Technology for Laypeople

This is a blog which I intend to publish on Github pages, mainly to test the possibilities afforded by Github for content publishing and custom domain name. Instead of publishing it as a series of markdown files, I have decided to publish this entire document as an HTML blog. I shall be writing the HTML, CSS and Javascript code for this project as well.


### TODO for HTML, CSS and Javascript part

  * Implement the font size changer
  * Implement the font changer
  * Implement the day/night mode changer.
  * Implement a more elegant way to return to the home page

### TODO for articles

  * Write the introduction to AI
  * Write the article on SGD
