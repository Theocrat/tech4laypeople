            ` In my last article, I wrote about the special methods for solving arithmetic problems which take advantage of repetition. As I said before, these methods are known as Numerical Optimization and we use them to make our AI model get good at solving problems that humans are meant to solve.`,
            `In this article, I will describe one of the major Numerical Methods in use - a particularly useful method known as the Stochastic Gradient Descent. Since this is considered a rather advanced topic, I will begin slowly, starting with a brief description of calculus since we make use of calculus in the Stochastic Gradient Descent method.`

            ` In recent years, we have seen the rise of artificial intelligence as a technology. Science fiction writers, of course, have written about it for a long time. And yet, the fact that we would one day actually be able to make computers think like us is something none of us could have believed easily.`,

            `But what really is Artificial Intelligence? Behind the gobbledegook of tech jargon and buzzwords, how does artificial intelligence really work? This article is an explanation of the basics of how modern AI systems work and do the awesome magic they do - from recognizing faces and understanding speech to translating text between langauges and even driving cars. `
