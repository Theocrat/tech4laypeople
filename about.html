            Welcome to my blog. I am Rajarshi, an AI product engineer with a masters in Electrical Engineering.
            I love technology, but not in the usual way. I am not very tech-savvy, in the conventional sense - 
            in fact, aside from my laptop and my smartphone, I do not trust any other electronic gadget around
            me. I have never owned a Mac, nor will I ever own one in the forseeable future. No, my love for 
            technology is of the other sort. I am fascinated by the way in which technology <i>works.</i>.
            I love <i>making</i> technology, or working on it anyway. I love programming software into existence, I 
            love the ingenuity with which humans have managed to manuever nature into such things as computers, 
            wireless networks and digital cameras.
        </p>
        <p>
            People in general tend to be fascinated by Black
            Holes, Neutron Stars, Quasars, Relativity, Mars, Fundamental Particles, String Theory, Genetics, and
            other branches of the pure sciences. However, when it comes to technology, nobody outside the
            specialization in question seems to have a clue as to what makes tech tick. What I find odd is that
            nobody seems to mind this. It is somehow normal for people to be excited about a Black Hole - something
            they will almost certainly never experience up close in their lives (fortunately!), but very few seem
            to bother about how the magic rectangle inside their pocket makes calls and sends messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have taken technology for granted, partly because we have mindlessly considered it to be an extension
            of science. This is a misleadingly assumption of equivalence - technology and engineering are an 
            entirely distinct domain. The way engineers solve the problems of technology is just as exciting as 
            Physics, even though we tend to get familiar with the outcomes of their efforts too quickly for us to 
            remain mystified with them for long. It is easy for laptops and bluetooth to feel mundane quickly,
            even though neutrinos tend to stand out as a sparkplug for the imagination. There is an entire genre 
            of writing called popular science, but there is no such genre as popular technology. I think that's a 
            shame, and that people would actually find descriptions of how technology works fascinating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping this in mind, I have resolved to write a sequence of articles about modern computing technology,
            such as artificial intelligence and Internet of Things. My intention is to create an easily accessible
            discussion about technology which is for the laypeople, and written with depth and coverage of the 
            technologies being discussed in mind. I have no intention of making these articles shallow just because 
            they are for laypeople. On the other hand, I hope to keep as much of the chore of technologies - the details 
            of maths and specifications and conventions and the nitty-gritties of day-to-day engineering - out of
            my articles as possible. I hope they are lucid, detailed and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am, of course, human. I can make mistakes when writing these articles. Hopefully, not all of my readers
            will be lay persons, and the odd engineer might pick up an error or two while reading these articles.
            If you think that I have messed up somewhere and you would like to correct me, please raise an issue on 
            <a href="https://github.com/Theocrat/tech4laypeople">this Github repository.</a>. It is the repo which
            contains this blog, and I am relaying this blog from the repo using Github Pages.
