                In my <a href="unpublished.html">last article</a>, 
                I wrote about the special methods for solving arithmetic
                problems which take advantage of repetition. As I said
                before, these methods are known as Numerical 
                Optimization and we use them to make our AI model get
                good at solving problems that humans are meant to solve.

                In this article, I will describe one of the major 
                Numerical Methods in use - a particularly useful method
                known as the Stochastic Gradient Descent. Since this is
                considered a rather advanced topic, I will begin slowly,
                starting with a brief description of calculus since we 
                make use of calculus in the Stochastic Gradient Descent
                method.

                In recent years, we have seen the rise of artificial 
                intelligence as a technology. Science fiction writers, 
                of course, have written about it for a long time. And 
                yet, the fact that we would one day actually be able to 
                make computers think like us is something none of us
                could have believed easily.

                But what really is Artificial Intelligence? Behind the 
                gobbledegook of tech jargon and buzzwords, how does
                artificial intelligence really work? This article is an 
                explanation of the basics of how modern AI systems work
                and do the awesome magic they do - from recognizing
                faces and understanding speech to translating text 
                between langauges and even driving cars.
